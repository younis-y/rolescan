# jobscan

[![ci](https://github.com/younis-y/jobscan/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/younis-y/jobscan/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A job scanner that reads employers' own career sites, scores postings against
your CV, and writes a ranked digest — spending an LLM call only on the small
minority that survive a deterministic prefilter.

**That prefilter is the design point.** On one real run it scanned 526 unique
postings across 9 employer sources and discarded 490 of them — **93%** — on
deterministic keyword rules before any model was invoked, leaving 36 to score.
The expensive stage sees a fortieth of the traffic, and the cheap stage is
reproducible and free to re-run.

Both the sources and the scoring backends load through **entry points**, so
adding an ATS adapter or swapping Claude for a local Ollama model is a plugin,
not a fork. **164 tests run offline** against `respx`-mocked transport — the real
HTTP clients and real parsers are exercised against recorded response shapes
rather than stubbed out — and `mypy` runs strict across `src` and `tests`.


## The two decisions worth reading the code for

**A deterministic prefilter runs before anything expensive.** Scoring is two
stages. The first is pure Python over the posting text: weighted keyword terms,
tripled when they appear in the title, minus blocker terms and a location
penalty. Postings below `min_keyword_score` never reach the second stage. Only
the survivors are sent to an LLM. In the run recorded in
`examples/run-summary.md` that stage discarded 490 of 526 postings before a
single model call. The ordering is the point: the cheap stage is not a
nicety, it is what decides the cost of the tool.

**Sources and LLM backends are both entry-point plugins.** They register
through `importlib.metadata` under the `jobscan.sources` and `jobscan.judges`
groups, declared in `pyproject.toml`. A third-party package can ship a new ATS
adapter or a new model backend without touching pipeline code, and the pipeline
holds no knowledge of either. Adding an employer on an already-supported
platform is a line of config and no code at all.

## Why it exists

Aggregators are late, partial, and full of recruiters. Postings arrive first on
the employer's own site, which is backed by an applicant-tracking system with a
public JSON API. jobscan reads those directly, so a role shows up the day it is
posted, from the source, with the real apply link.

The hard part is not fetching. It is knowing that Octopus Energy's board is
`octoenergy` on Lever and not `octopus` on Greenhouse. `jobscan slugs` and
`jobscan discover` exist for exactly that.

## What it reads

| Source | Needs a key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `greenhouse` `lever` `ashby` `workable` | no | public JSON, one request per board |
| `smartrecruiters` | no | paginated. Returns 200 with zero rows for a slug that does not exist, so `discover` reports `UNKNOWN` rather than lying |
| `workday` | no | needs tenant, site and host, all three readable from the careers URL |
| `structured` | no | any site publishing schema.org `JobPosting` plus a sitemap. Covers Phenom People, SAP SuccessFactors, Teamtailor and Harbour today, by configuration rather than by adapter |
| `adzuna` | yes | the one aggregator. Free tier, 20 countries |

## How scoring works

**1. Keywords.** Pure Python, no network, no credentials. Described above. You
can stop here: `--no-llm` still gives a ranked, deduplicated, seen-tracked
digest.

**2. An LLM,** optionally. It picks which of your CV variants to send, scores
fit, flags hard eligibility bars, and names concrete edits to make. Verdicts
are cached on a content hash of the posting text, so re-running costs nothing
for unchanged postings.

The backend is a plugin. `jobscan backends` lists what is registered:

| Name | Needs a key | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude API. Best quality. Needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. |
| `ollama` | no | Local model via Ollama. Free, offline, no key. NOT YET VERIFIED against a live server. |

The Anthropic backend has run against the live API: the 25 August 2026 run in
`examples/run-summary.md` scored 36 postings through it, with no failures
reported. That key has since been revoked, so the run is a record rather than
something you can re-execute. The Ollama backend has never run against a live
instance. Both are written to
their documented contracts and covered by tests against a mocked server, which
proves the request shape, the schema validation and the error handling, but not
the contracts themselves. The Ollama path sends a JSON Schema in `format`, so
`FitVerdict` still arrives validated either way. Treat the first real run of
either as the test.

With `llm.enabled: false`, or with no key and no local model, you get stage one
alone. If a configured backend fails, the digest says so rather than quietly
serving keyword scores that look like a normal run — there is a test that
asserts exactly this.

## What you must supply

- **Your own `config.yaml`.** Nothing is shipped. `config.example.yaml`
  documents every knob; `examples/energy-trading.yaml` is a fully resolved,
  working source list for UK and Gulf energy, with a placeholder profile.
- **Your own API key.** Every secret resolves from the environment when the
  corresponding config field is left blank: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and optionally
  `ADZUNA_APP_ID` / `ADZUNA_APP_KEY` and `JOBSCAN_SMTP_PASS`. Nothing is
  bundled, and `config.yaml` is gitignored so a key pasted there by hand does
  not follow you into a commit.
- **Your own CV files**, if you want tailoring advice rather than generic
  advice. See `cvs/README.md`.
- **Your own ATS slug dataset**, if you want `jobscan slugs`. See
  `ats-data/README.md`. It is CC BY-NC 4.0 and is not bundled here.

Relative paths resolve against the config file, not the working directory, so a
cron job writes to the same database as an interactive run.

## Results

One run, 25 August 2026, against a private config covering the same employers
as `examples/energy-trading.yaml`:

| | |
|---|---|
| Unique postings fetched | 526 |
| Sources contributing | 9 |
| Discarded by the keyword prefilter | 490 (93%) |
| Sent to stage two | 36 |
| Scored from cache | 0 (first run) |

The counters and the per-source outcome footer from that run are reproduced in
`examples/run-summary.md`. The ranked postings are not: a digest records one
person's job search, and that is not something to publish. This is one
measurement against one source list, not a benchmark — the discard rate is a
function of how tightly you write your keywords.

## Commands

```
jobscan discover     probe every configured source; report OK / EMPTY / UNKNOWN / SKIPPED / FAIL
jobscan slugs NAME   find a real board slug in a harvested ATS dataset
jobscan sources      every registered source kind and its slug format
jobscan backends     every registered LLM backend, and which need a key
jobscan cvs          which CV variants were found and how they parse
jobscan scan         fetch, score, write the digest   (--dry, --no-llm, --no-email)
jobscan show         reprint the latest digest
jobscan stats        how many postings the store has seen
jobscan prune        drop stale cached verdicts
```

`discover` distinguishes five outcomes on purpose. `EMPTY` means a real board
with no openings; `UNKNOWN` means an API that cannot tell an empty board from a
wrong slug. Collapsing those into a single "OK" hides which of them actually returned postings. ## Finding slugs

`jobscan slugs` searches a harvested ATS directory you download yourself. It
matches on `difflib.SequenceMatcher` with a length-aware cap and a directional
containment bonus, because absolute name length rather than length ratio is
what separates `octoenergy` from `octopusenergy` without also collapsing `vitl`
into `vitol`.

The dataset has no SmartRecruiters file and covers no bespoke platforms, so
expect to resolve some employers by hand: open the careers page, follow where it
redirects, and read the ATS and slug out of the final URL. `discover` then
confirms or refutes it.

## Scope

What this does not claim:

- **Neither LLM backend has been run against a live server.** See above.
- **Public endpoints only.** Nothing behind a login, no session cookies, no
  captcha solving, no scraping of anything a careers page does not serve to an
  anonymous browser.
- **Five ATS platforms have first-class adapters** — Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby,
  Workable, SmartRecruiters — plus Workday, which needs three values rather
  than a slug. Everything else is reached through the generic schema.org source
  or not at all.
- **The slug dataset is third-party, incomplete and not redistributable.** It
  ships no SmartRecruiters file. Slug resolution remains partly manual.
- **Not a tracker.** It records what it has seen so it does not show you the
  same posting twice. It does not manage applications, and it does not apply to
  anything on your behalf.
- **The scores are a triage heuristic**, not a prediction of whether you will be
  interviewed.

## Reading the source

The module docstrings are written to record negative results, not just to
describe what the code does. Why length ratio is the wrong discriminator for
slug matching; why conditional GETs are useless against employers who answer
`If-Modified-Since` with 200 and the full body, leaving sitemap `lastmod` as
the only workable cache-invalidation signal; why Workday's 422 and 404 mean
opposite things, one a wrong tenant and one a wrong site; why SmartRecruiters'
zero result count is never verification. Approaches that were tried and
rejected are written down where the next person will hit them, which is the
main reason the docstrings are long.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest && mypy src tests && ruff check .
```

The suite is 164 tests and runs in about two seconds with no network: `respx`
mocks the transport, so the real HTTP clients and the real parsers are exercised
against recorded response shapes rather than being stubbed out. `mypy` runs
strict over `src` and `tests`.

The suite is offline by construction: HTTP is mocked with `respx`, so tests
exercise the real client and the real parsers against recorded payloads rather
than stubs. mypy runs in strict mode over `src` and `tests`. CI runs all three
on Python 3.11 and 3.12 — see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
