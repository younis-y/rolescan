"""LLM backends, as plugins.

Every source except Adzuna is a public endpoint and keyword scoring is pure
Python, so the LLM stage is the only part of rolescan that ever needed a
credential. Making it a plugin keeps the tool useful with none: run the
keyword prefilter alone, point it at a local model, or supply an API key —
the pipeline, the cache, the digest and the CV matching are identical either
way.

A judge does one thing: turn a rendered prompt into a validated FitVerdict.
Everything expensive and easy to get wrong — the verdict cache, the spend
ceiling, concurrency, ordering, error counting — stays in FitScorer, so a new
backend is one method rather than a fork of the scorer.

Registration mirrors `rolescan.sources`: subclass, decorate with @register, or
ship one from another package under the `rolescan.judges` entry-point group.
