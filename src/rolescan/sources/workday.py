"""Workday.

Worth the extra effort: ADNOC and most large Gulf and UK industrial employers
run Workday, and none of them appear in any free aggregator. The public careers
site is a React app talking to a "CXS" JSON endpoint, which is what this hits.

Unlike the other ATS feeds it needs three coordinates, because one Workday
tenant can host several branded career sites:

    sources:
      - kind: workday
        slug: adnoc            # tenant
        site: ADNOC_Careers    # career site id
        host: wd3              # wd1..wd103, from the careers URL
