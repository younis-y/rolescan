"""Source plugin contract and registry.

A source is any object that can turn a configured slug into a list of Jobs.
Adding one means subclassing Source and decorating it with @register, or
shipping it from another package under the `jobscan.sources` entry-point group.
Neither route requires touching pipeline code.
