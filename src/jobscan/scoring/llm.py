"""Stage two: LLM fit scoring and CV matching.

Uses the Claude API's structured outputs, so `FitVerdict` comes back as a
validated pydantic object rather than JSON that has to be coaxed out of prose.
The schema is enforced by grammar-constrained sampling at the API, which means
no parse-retry loop and no defensive JSON repair.

Three things keep this cheap:
  * the keyword prefilter, so only plausible roles get here at all
  * a persistent verdict cache keyed on the description text
  * a hard per-run call ceiling

Scoring guidance:
- 85-100: strong match, apply today.
- 65-84: worth applying, some gaps.
- 40-64: stretch or partial match, only if the pipeline is thin.
- 0-39: not a good use of their time.

Be strict about seniority. A role wanting eight years is not a 70 for someone \
with one internship and a master's, however well the keywords line up.

Set verdict to "blocked" ONLY for hard structural bars the candidate cannot \
clear by being a better applicant: a nationality requirement such as an \
Emiratisation "UAE National" or "National Talent programme" posting, a \
security clearance, or a work authorisation they do not hold. A blocked role \
should also get a low fit_score. Being underqualified is "skip", not "blocked".

For tailoring, name concrete edits to the chosen CV: which bullet to change and \
to what. "Tailor your CV" is useless. "Lead the internship bullet with the data \
quality monitoring, since the posting names observability twice" is useful.
