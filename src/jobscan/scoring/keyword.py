"""Stage one: the cheap deterministic prefilter.

This is not trying to be clever. Its whole job is to throw away the eighty
percent of postings that are obviously irrelevant, so the LLM only ever reads
plausible ones. That is what keeps a daily scan across forty employers costing
pennies rather than pounds.

It also runs standalone when no API key is configured, so the tool degrades to
something useful rather than to nothing.
